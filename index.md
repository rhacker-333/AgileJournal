# Agile & Project Management Notes

Welcome to my personal Agile and Project Management notes site!

> **Origin of These Notes:**  
> All material here is transcribed and organized from my original handwritten class notes. Since those notes were difficult to read and share, I decided to digitize them for my own future reference and to present them in a clearer, more accessible format.
