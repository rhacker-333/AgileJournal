# Agile Fundamentals

Agile software development centers on delivering working solutions iteratively, emphasizing adaptability and value at every step. Key principles include:

- **Iterative Development:** Work is divided into short “sprints”, enabling regular feedback and flexibility.
- **Customer Centricity:** Continuous alignment with customer needs and direct feedback loops.
- **Team Collaboration:** Agile teams prioritize open communication, cross-functionality, and shared ownership.
- **Flexibility and Adaptation:** Requirements can evolve as teams learn and customer priorities shift.

## The Agile Roadmap

- **Vision & Mission:** Projects begin with a clear vision and mission, which define strategy and overall direction.
- **Themes & Epics:** Goals are decomposed into major themes, which consist of related epics (large user stories).
- **Backlog:** Features and tasks are collected in a product backlog, prioritized for incremental delivery.
- **Release Planning:** Teams plan releases based on business value and technical feasibility.

**Examples:** Spotify and Netflix use Agile methodologies to prioritize user feedback and continually improve their products.
