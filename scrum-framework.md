# Scrum Framework

Scrum is a widely used Agile framework for iterative product development. It defines roles, ceremonies, and artifacts that structure teamwork and ensure progress.

## Scrum Events (Ceremonies)

- **Sprint:** A time-boxed development cycle (1â€“4 weeks) delivering a potentially shippable increment.
- **Sprint Planning:** The team determines sprint goals and selects backlog items for the sprint.
- **Daily Standup:** A short meeting to synchronize progress and plan for the day.
- **Sprint Review:** Demonstration of completed work to stakeholders and feedback gathering.
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Reflection on the sprint, celebrating successes and identifying improvement areas.

## Scrum Roles

- **Product Owner:** Maximizes product value by prioritizing and managing the backlog.
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates Scrum practices and removes team impediments.
- **Development Team:** Cross-functional members responsible for building the product.

## Scrum Artifacts

- **Product Backlog:** Ordered list of everything needed in the product.
- **Sprint Backlog:** Subset of backlog items committed to during a sprint.
- **Increment:** The sum of all completed product backlog items during a sprint.

Visual tools like Scrum Boards help teams track progress and workflow (To Do, In Progress, Done).
