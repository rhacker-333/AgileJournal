# Agile Testing: TDD & BDD

Testing is integral in Agile, with approaches focused on quality and rapid feedback.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

- Write tests before code implementation.
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
  1. **Red:** Write a failing test.
  2. **Green:** Write code to pass the test.
  3. **Refactor:** Improve code without breaking behavior.

Benefits include modularity, reduced debugging time, and higher code quality.

## Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

- Write acceptance criteria in plain language (`Given-When-Then` format).
- Involves both technical and non-technical team members for clear understanding.
- Tools like Cucumber and JUnit automate scenario-based testing in Java.

Collaborative testing ensures requirements are met and builds team confidence.
