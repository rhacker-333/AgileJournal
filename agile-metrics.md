# Agile Metrics

Metrics help teams track progress and identify areas for improvement.

## Key Metrics

- **Velocity:** Amount of work completed in a sprint; indicates team output.
- **Sprint Burndown Chart:** Visualizes remaining work in a sprint.
- **Sprint Burnup Chart:** Tracks work completed over time.
- **Cycle Time:** Time taken to complete a specific task.
- **Lead Time:** Total time from feature request to delivery.

Monitoring these metrics enables teams to forecast delivery and optimize workflows.
