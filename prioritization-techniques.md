# Prioritization Techniques

Backlog management ensures high-value work is tackled first.

## MoSCoW Method

- **Must-Have:** Critical features for functionality.
- **Should-Have:** Significant but not essential.
- **Could-Have:** Nice-to-have without core impact.
- **Won't-Have:** Out of scope or low priority.

## WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)

Prioritizes work based on cost of delay and duration:
`WSJF = Cost of Delay / Job Duration`

Considers user experience, time criticality, risk reduction, and opportunity enablement.

Continuous backlog refinement improves delivery and customer satisfaction.
