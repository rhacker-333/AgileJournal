# AgileJournal

AgileJournal is a knowledge blog transforming my class notes from an Agile and Project Management course into quick, easy-to-understand guides for students and professionals. The blog explores:

- **Agile Fundamentals**: Principles, values, and core methodologies.
- **Scrum Process**: Roles, ceremonies, and workflows.
- **Hands-on Jira**: Creating bugs, issues, epics, and stories in Jira software.
- **Testing Practices & Approaches**: Introduction to concepts like Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), including their application and relevance in Agile projects.
- **Project Management Basics**: Insights from real-world case studies (Bosch, Slack, etc.), focusing on how Agile was implemented and scaled in various industries.
- **Learning Outcomes**: Practical techniques and real project experiences for personal and professional growth.

All notes originated from my classroom experience and are tailored for easy application. Browse, learn, and accelerate your Agile journey!
